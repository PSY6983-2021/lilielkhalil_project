Hello !!

My name is Lili El Khalil,
I am in my first year of master student at University of Montreal studying psychology.
I am a research assistant with Marie Audrey Lavoie in the visual neurocognition laboratory.

<heading 2>
<b> Why BrainHack School? </B>
When joining the BrainHack School, i was looking farward in particular to know more about data analyses
Which means to be able to analyse my research data results later on.

In my research Laboratory i was only working with Matlab, but in BrainHack School i had the opportunity to discover more than one application and method
And in my university courses i only learned on HTML 

You can join me on GitHub at [lilielkhalil](https://github.com/lilielkhalil)or by mail at <lilykhalil98@gmail.com>
